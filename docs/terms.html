    <h1>End-User License Agreement (EULA)</h1>

    <p>This application is licensed, not sold. By using this software, you agree to the following terms:</p>

    <h2>1. Purpose of the License</h2>
    <p>The software is provided for personal or commercial use depending on your license type. Unauthorized copying, redistribution, or resale is prohibited.</p>

    <h2>2. Hardware Identification</h2>
    <p>To issue a valid license, the application collects and sends anonymous <strong>hardware identification hashes</strong> (e.g., CPU, device ID) to the license server.</p>
    <p>This data is <strong>not personally identifiable</strong> and is used solely to bind the license to a single machine and prevent misuse.</p>

    <h2>3. Privacy and Data Handling</h2>
    <p>No personal data is collected. Only non-reversible hardware hashes are sent securely to the server. These are used only to verify license validity.</p>

    <h2>4. License Validity</h2>
    <p>Licenses are valid for the duration specified at the time of issue. If the hardware changes significantly, the license may become invalid.</p>

    <h2>5. Acceptance</h2>
    <p>By proceeding, you confirm that you have read and accepted these terms and agree to the transmission of required hardware hashes for licensing purposes.</p>
